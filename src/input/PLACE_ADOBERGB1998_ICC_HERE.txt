Optional source profile for gamut mapping (-S/-s)

Place AdobeRGB1998.icc (or another source ICC) in this folder and set
[colprof].gamut_map_both or gamut_map_perceptual in src/profile_config.ini.

Notes:
- If the profile is missing, the builder will skip -S/-s and warn.
- You can also set an absolute path in the config instead of placing the file here.
